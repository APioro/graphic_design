       <p>
In my second year of design school, I was in a three-person team tasked with redesigning Absolute Collagen’s mobile webshop. The goal was to redesign their mobile webshop.

The audience was women age 25-60, mostly middle-class with interest with wellness and beauty. <br><br>

I took on the product page—everything from first impressions, searching for info, adding to cart to UI consistency—and also took over the menu redesign after a teammate left (happends...).

            <div class="text-left-sided">
            <p>Navigation and the product page were fairly straightforward to prototype. Once I understood the information structure users expected, implementation came naturally.
                </p>
                <p>Because of that, I focused the prototyping phase on the add-to-cart flow with the subscription option, which turned out to be the most complex (and interesting) part of the project.

             <h4> 2.1 Requirement: Purchase & Subscription Models </h4>
              
                <p class="short">This part was by far the hardest. The business logic was complex, but the UI had to feel effortless and obvious to the user.
                    <ul>
                        <li>One-time purchase + two subscription options (every 2 weeks / every 4 weeks)</b></li>
                        <li>Each option had different prices and box quantities</b></li>
                        <li>The challenge was making these differences easy to understand at a glance</b></li>
                        <li>Few good real-world examples existed, so the solution had to be designed from scratch</b></li>

            <p>UI had multiple visual directions across the site, so I streamlined it by choosing a single primary yellow, unifying buttons, icons, and typography, and designing flexible assets for infographics and social media.

                Especially to test subscription logic. 
                Even well-researched patterns still need real-world testing when multiple pricing models are present.
