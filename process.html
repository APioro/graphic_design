                   <h2> Discovery Call </h2>
                <p class="short">
                    Once you’ve reached out through my booking form, I’ll be in touch to arrange a call if the project feels like a good fit. 
                    This is our chance to meet, chat, and set the stage for our creative journey together.
                    <br><br>
                    During the call, my focus is on really listening — getting to know your goals, your audience, and the “why” behind your project.
                    I’ll guide the conversation with questions, but it’s really just an open, relaxed space to share your vision.
                    <br><br>
                    After our call, I’ll create a clear proposal that lays out the scope of work, the deliverables, timeline, and the investment. If everything feels right, I’ll send over the agreement and deposit invoice — and then we’re ready to get moving.
                </p>

            <h2>Brand Strategy Presentation</h2>
            <p class="short">
                After the deposit, I send a short questionnaire to dive deeper into your brand — your values, personality, audience, and goals. This helps me understand exactly what makes your business unique and what you want to communicate.
                <br><br>
                I create 2–3 visual directions (mood boards) that explore different ways your brand could look and feel. Each board shows colors, typography, layout style, and overall mood — all tied to the strategy from your questionnaire.
                <br><br>
                In a meeting, we review these boards together and decide which direction feels right. This becomes the foundation for all the design work to come.

            <h2>Design Development</h2>
            <p class="short">
                Once the visual direction is approved, I create your brand assets: logo, color palette, typography, patterns, illustrations, and any supporting materials. Everything is designed to reflect your brand strategy and goals.

            <h2>Presentation</h2>
            <p class="short">
                Once the design is ready, I’ll prepare a clear presentation for you. Instead of just sending over files, I show you how the design works in context — on mockups, applications, and touchpoints that make it easy to imagine your brand in the real world.
                <br><br>
                Each concept comes with an explanation of the thinking behind it, so you understand not only what it looks like, but why it was designed that way.

            <h2>Refinements & Offboarding</h2>
            <p class="short">
                Depending on your package, this usually includes 1–2 rounds of feedback and adjustments. In case any changes need to be made, we will discuss them to make sure you are happy with the outcome.
                <br><br>
                By the end of this stage, you’ll have a design that feels confident, professional, and fully aligned with your strategy. I will deliver the files neatly organized together with simple guidelines. If at any time you need help with using your brand, feel free to contact me. I aim to establish a long-term relationship with my clients.
