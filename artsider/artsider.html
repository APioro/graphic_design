                Artsider Foundation, based in Kraków, is dedicated to giving visibility to artists living with schizophrenia. 
                Their mission is to replace stigma with dialogue, showing that art created in the midst of mental health struggles 
                has the same power to move, inspire, and connect. They wanted a brand identity that reflects this: inclusive, optimistic, 
                and authentic—something that speaks as much to the warmth of community as to the individuality of each artist’s vision.
                While their artwork often appears on coffee cups in cafés, Artsider’s impact goes far beyond: it’s about shaping a cultural 
                space where creativity is seen as universal and difference becomes a source of beauty and strength.

       The foundation needed a branding system that would reflect inclusivity, optimism, and authenticity. Their previous identity felt unclear and inconsistent, lacking the warmth and energy that represented their mission. The challenge was to create a visual language that could both respect the seriousness of their work and radiate the joy and creativity of the artists they support.

      The logo combines a circle symbolizing openness and community with a bold, off-center mark that conveys authenticity and difference. A friendly, organic type system balances legibility with human character. The refreshed color palette preserves the recognizable turquoise and orange while introducing yellow and pastel pink to inject lightness and optimism. Supporting patterns, inspired by recurring motifs in artists’ works—spirals, eyes, butterflies—add depth and flexibility to the identity. Together, these elements form a system that feels professional yet approachable, able to live across digital, print, campaigns, and everyday touchpoints like coffee cups.
